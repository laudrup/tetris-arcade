Tetris-Arcade
=============

Tetris clone based on the tetris example from the python arcade
distribution.

This adds more interesting graphics, levels, a two player mode and
more to the very basic [tetris example from Python
Arcade](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/examples/tetris.html).

There are most likely much more interesting Tetris implementations out
there, but of course contributions and bug reports that could make
this better are very much welcome.
